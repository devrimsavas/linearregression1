
Machine Learning Introduction 1

I was planning such tutorial for beginners especially for those who are confused and lost in this path 
Machine learning 1 with 2 different modules 
linear regression is the first step of machine learning modelling. In this example, we used an imaginary dataset X: years of experience and y: Salary: 
our aim is use two different modules (scipy and sklearn) and see if there any difference between 2 different ways. 
first of all we convert data to numpy arrays. Even if scipy does not need such conversion, we do it for better and further analyze and sklearn module need such conversion.
we create our models and it allows us to enter experience of years to calculate prediction. 
it is also important to show R values.User can use entry box to calculate prediction. 

Conclusion: As program reveals there is not big difference between 2 different modules.
Program: inorder to show graphics in same time, i prefered to use embedded graphics. 
It is a basic machine learning and prediction models. 
feel free to ask if you have difficulties to understand.
